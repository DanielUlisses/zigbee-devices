## Energy Dashboard Configuration

After setting up your switch energy statistics, add them to the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard:

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Energy**
2. Under "Individual Devices", click **Add Device**
3. Select your energy sensors:
   - For daily tracking: `sensor.{name}_gang_{n}_energy_daily`
   - For longer term: `sensor.{name}_gang_{n}_energy_monthly`

## Automation Examples

### Track Total Daily Usage
```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Kitchen Total Daily Energy"
        unit_of_measurement: "Wh"
        device_class: energy
        state: >
          {{ (states('sensor.kitchen_gang_1_energy_daily') | float) +
             (states('sensor.kitchen_gang_2_energy_daily') | float) +
             (states('sensor.kitchen_gang_3_energy_daily') | float) +
             (states('sensor.kitchen_gang_4_energy_daily') | float) }}
```

### Cost Calculation
```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Living Room Daily Energy Cost"
        unit_of_measurement: "$"
        state: >
          {{ (states('sensor.living_room_gang_1_energy_daily') | float * 0.12 / 1000) | round(2) }}
        # Assumes $0.12 per kWh
```

### Weekly Energy Reset Notification
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Weekly Energy Reset"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "00:00:00"
    condition:
      condition: time
      weekday:
        - mon
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app
      data:
        title: "Weekly Energy Reset"
        message: >
          Last week's total: 
          Living Room: {{ states('sensor.living_room_gang_1_energy_weekly') }}Wh
          Kitchen: {{ states('sensor.kitchen_gang_1_energy_weekly') }}Wh
```

## Tips for Accurate Power Values

1. **Measure if possible**: Use a power meter to measure actual consumption
2. **Check device labels**: Many devices list power consumption on labels
3. **Use manufacturer specs**: Check product documentation
4. **Start conservative**: Begin with lower estimates and adjust based on usage patterns
5. **Consider efficiency**: LED drivers, transformers may add 10-20% overhead
6. **Update seasonally**: Some devices (fans, heaters) may vary by season
